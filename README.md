# HR Employee Retention Prediction 🎯

This project uses Machine Learning to predict whether an employee is likely to leave a company or not, based on various HR-related factors. It includes data analysis, model building (Logistic Regression and Random Forest), performance evaluation, and a deployed Streamlit web app for real-time prediction.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict employee retention using HR data
- **Dataset**: Includes employee satisfaction level, evaluation scores, projects, working hours, promotions, salary levels, and departments
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit

## 📊 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations on salary and department impact on retention
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest Models
- Model Evaluation with Confusion Matrix and Classification Report
- Real-time employee prediction using a Streamlit app
- Deployment-ready with `requirements.txt` and `app.py`

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

| Model              | Accuracy |
|-------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | ~78.6%   |
| Random Forest       | ~98.8%   |

Random Forest clearly outperforms Logistic Regression in this case.
